# Voting Assistant

## Introduction
While choosing a candidate to vote for, a person might go through the information available on his/her prefered candidate. Now the problem arises with fact checking, since there are multiple sources of information these days, it might be difficult to go through all of them and come to a conclusion. Whereas a summarized view of all the candidates in the constituency might help the voter to make a more informed decision.

## Methodology
Our approach to the problem of summarizing candidate information boils down to 2 metrics which can help a voter decide between two candidates. We plan to indicate an overall metric to display the effectiveness of a candidate. Along with that another metric indicating the contribution of an individual voter toward the chance of a candidate being elected.
